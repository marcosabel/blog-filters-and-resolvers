# Readme

Example code for the post about filters and resolvers published at trabe.io.

In the post we iterate about different versions of the solution. I kept all the versions of the filter and the resolvers in the codebase but 
the application is configured to use the latest iteration. 

If you want to test a different  version you need to change the class MvcConfiguration.

To start the application use:

mvn spring-boot:run
